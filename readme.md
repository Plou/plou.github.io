Front-end developer & Teacher

Living in Lille, France
I'm available to work anywhere.

## Hi there!
I'm working with web agencies and design teams to build solid, performant, accessible websites and living style guides. I also enjoy working with developers and designers teams to improve their workflow and front-end skills.

Aside from that you can find me teaching CMS in university or running workshops about web technologies.

## What can I do for you?
### UI Systems
To tame technical debt and scallability, with the help of the design team, we will build a style guide to keep consistent interfaces.

### Interactive Interfaces
Working with the designers, we will craft meaningful animations and interactions

### Wordpress & Typo3
While building complex layouts, together with the editors, we will set up a simple and powerful administration system.

### Courses & Workshops
From student training to front-end masterclass, let's learn and improve together.

## Some projects I have been working on
